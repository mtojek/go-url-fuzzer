# go-url-fuzzer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mtojek/go-url-fuzzer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mtojek/go-url-fuzzer)

Status: **Done**

Discover hidden files and directories on a web server. The application tries to find url relative paths of the given website by comparing them with a given set. Go-url-fuzzer is inspired by [Indir Scanner](http://indir.uw-team.org/), which is written in Perl. Comparing to Indir Scanner, the application supports concurrent url fuzzing.

## Features

* Fuzz url set from an input file
* Concurrent relative path search
* Configurable number of fuzzing workers
* Configurable time wait periods between fuzz tests per worker
* Custom HTTP headers support
* Various HTTP methods support

## Usage

Make sure you install [v0 of goflow](https://github.com/trustmaster/goflow/tree/v0).
